This is the work we've done on the Zindi flood prediction competition.

First of all, we've done some Exploratory Data Analysis to try and get insights from the data along with feature selection (Filter method and backward elimination) but it wasn't very significant.
After it, we've tried to do a model selection, and hyper parameter tuning to the gradient boosting using grid search.
Finally, we tried to train a ANN with two headen layers and the results we got are in a file named "ML malawi ANN".
